# End-to-end Chatbot

This repository contains a simple chatbot implemented in Python. The chatbot uses a logistic regression classifier trained on intent patterns to generate responses. It's built using the Streamlit framework for the user interface.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the chatbot using `streamlit run app.py`.

## Usage

1. Start the chatbot by running `streamlit run app.py`.
2. Type your message in the input field and press Enter.
3. The chatbot will respond with an appropriate message based on the input.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main script for running the chatbot.
- `intent.pkl`: Pickled file containing intent patterns and tags.
- `clf.pkl`: Pickled classifier model.
- `vec.pkl`: Pickled vectorizer for text data.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding more intents, improving the classifier, or enhancing the user interface.
